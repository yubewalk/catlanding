                <p>The 115th annual Cat Fancy Event is being held in New York City on December 21st. This is the fanciest cat event of the year, starring over 300 different cats. This event was made to show America how great cats really are. There will be treats at the walk in, and for the cat owners, there will be a buffet in the lounge. We thank you for coming to our event site, and hope to see you on December 21st. Thank you.</p>
